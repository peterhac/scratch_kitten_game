# scratch_kitten_game
Code using Scratch for Cherry Blossom Kitten Catch, a simple video game. 

This is a game made using Scratch for the Harvard CS50x Course. 

The object of the game is to move the kitten sprite left and right across the screen using the arrow keys in order to collect points based on the number of falling blossoms collected. Single blossoms are worth 1 point. Double blossoms are worth 2 points. Triple blossoms are worth 3 points. 

Ninja stars are worth -5 points and cost 1 life, and also stun the kitten sprite for a few fractions of a second. 

If the kitten's lives drop to zero, the game is over. 
If the score reaches 50, the player wins!
